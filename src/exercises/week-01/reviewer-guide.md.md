# Week 01 – Reviewer Guide

This guide outlines what to check for when reviewing a student’s Week 01 submission.

## ✅ What to Check

### File
- Student is working in: `src/exercises/week-01/studentWork.jsx`
- The file exports a React component.


### Inside the Component
- A variable for their **name**
- A variable for their **age**
- An **array of hobbies**

### JSX Output
- A heading about themselves
- A short intro paragraph
- A list of hobbies rendered with **.map()**

### Quality
- Component exports correctly
- No unnecessary complexity (no hooks, props, etc.)
- JSX is valid and renders without errors

## ❌ Common Issues to Watch For
- Variables created **outside** the component
- Hobbies rendered manually instead of mapped
- Missing export statement
- Broken JSX or missing return statement
